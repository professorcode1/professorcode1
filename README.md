<p>
Its only slightly less realistic than the Microsoft Flight Simulator <strong>BUT</strong>>

 1. Its significantly more performant 📈

 2. Its Free and Open Source 🤯

<p>
You still here? 😕

Ok so you don't wanna play the game 🤔. 

Perhaps you are a nerd 🤓 and would like to do some statistical analysis🧑‍🔬

Boy do I have the thing for you!

<p>
<h2>Event Analysis 📊</h2>
<p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/professorcode1/Event-Analysis">this</a> python package I made that's used to perform Event Synchronisation and Event Coincidence Analysis. These are two methods used to calculate correlation b/w event series. Its <strong>GPU accelerated</strong> via CUDA so its <strong>super fast</strong>🏎️.
