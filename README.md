Its only slightly less realistic than the Microsoft Flight Simulator <em>BUT</em>

 1. Its significantly more performant 📈

 2. Its Free and Open Source 🤯

<p>
You still here?😕

Ok so you don't wanna play the game🤔. 

Perhaps you are a nerd🤓 and would like to do some statistical analysis🧑‍🔬

Boy do I have the thing for you!

<p>
<h2>Event Analysis</h2>
<p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/professorcode1/Event-Analysis">this</a> python package I made that's used to perform Event Synchronisation and Event Coincidence Analysis. These are two methods used to calculate correlation b/w event series. Its **GPU accelerated** via CUDA so its ***super fast***🏎️.
